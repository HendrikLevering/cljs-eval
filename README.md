# de.levering-it/cljs-eval



Do you want to be able to run cljs directly from your clj repl?
Cljs-eval gives you a way to create a headless browser repl, which you can use to
run cljs code directly from clj. It uses playwright to establish the browser repl.

## Getting Started

Get dependency:

    de.levering-it/cljs-eval {:mvn/version "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"}

All functions are in the `de.levering-it/cljs-eval` namepace

Require needed dependencies:

    $ (require '[de.levering-it.cljs-eval :refer [enable-cljs-eval! cljs-eval cljs-eval! with-cljs read-fn]])
    nil

And you are ready to go:

    $ (cljs-eval! (+ 1 1))
    2

cljs-eval! takes a form evals it in the browser repl and returns the result.
It will also print stdout and stderr and forward tap.
The return value is parsedd with edn/read-string. Therefore it will throw an exception, if the return value is not a valid edn. You can rebind read-fn to a function, which parses the return value in a different way.

    $ (binding [read-fn identity]
            (cljs-eval! (+ 1 1)))
        "2"

You are realy evaluating in the context of the browser repl and you can use the result directly in CLJ

    (cljs-eval! (set! (.-title js/document) "Foobar"))
    (= "Foobar" (cljs-eval! (.-title js/document))) ; => true

cljs-eval! takes a form. It can be cumbersome to write this form manually especially if you want to use the result of a clojure expression in that form.
with-cljs! allows you to define symbols, whos value is the result of a clojure expression and use that symbol in the form. with-cljs works like a let, where every binding is evaluated in CLJ and the body is evaluated in the browser repl.

    $ (let [x 40
            y 2]
        (with-cljs [a x
                    b y]
          (+ a b))) ; => 42

Destructuring works, too.

    $ (= (with-cljs [[{:keys [x]} b] [{:x 5} 2]
                          x (* x 2)
                          y x]
                (+ x y b)) 22) ; this runs in the CLJS browser repl.  x y b are replaced by the values from the CLJ evaluation.

A limitation is that evaluations in the bindings block must produce plain serializable values.

cljs-eval! and with-cljs! enable the cljs evaluation if it is not enabled already.
You can enable it manually:

    $ (enable-cljs-eval!)

Note: The same evaluation context is used for all cljs-eval! calls as long as the JVM repl process is running.

There is also a low level function, which accepts a raw string.

    $ (cljs-eval "(println 1 1)")
    ; 1 1
    {:tag :ret, :val "nil", :ns "cljs.user", :ms 10, :form "(println 1 1)"}


## Limitations

Teardown of cljs repl from with the jvm process does not work. If you need to a fresh cljs repl, you have to restart your jvm repl. If you try to restart the cljs repl from within
the JVM process, then the next cljs-eval will freeze. This is due to some strange behaviour in the socket-repl or playwright thread, which I do not fully understand. Hints to fix this are
welcome :-).

cljs-eval! and with-cljs macro use edn/string to parse the result val by default. Any result which is not a plain datastructure will throw. You can
receive the origin result with ex-data.

The cljs context under the hood is a socket repl. The repl is started in a headless browser. It uses http://localhost:9000 to host the repl. Therefore take care that you do not use this library more than once in different JVM processes at the same time.
